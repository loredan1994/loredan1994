### ⚡ One line that describes me best? 
I like to solve problems. Throughout my career, I have been driven by my intellectual curiosity to find answers to the most pressing questions. Whether it's finding the perfect product/device for the work environment to solving critical issues that occur in IT systems, I've been able to quickly uncover the mysteries causing the issues and solve the customer's pain point with a strategic and effective solution. 
With my refined skill set, I bring to the table, critical and strategic thinking accompanied by effective resolutions throughout the day in the IT field. 

My intellectual curiosity also drives me to be a lifelong learner, I am currently working very hard to obtain a series of certifications that would prove my expertise and knowledge in certain areas such as Microsoft products, security, networking and automation.😉😉
